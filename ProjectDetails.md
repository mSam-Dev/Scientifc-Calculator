## Summary
This project is a web-based calculator with notable functionality and unique design.
I decided to include in the calculator a few usefull scientific features such trigonometric math, logarithms, pi, bracketing, square roots, and percentages giving it more functionality than many simple web based calculators.
In addition to this, the calculator has a Night mode toggle for individuals such as myself who prefer a darker theme.
This application is responsively designed so it retains full functionality on mobile and desktop.

## Technical Details
For the initial idea mock-ups and design prototypes I used **Figma**.\
For development of the website I used **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**.\
For hosting the website, I used **GitHub Pages**.

All calculation functionality is done using the built in JavaScript mathematics functions.
