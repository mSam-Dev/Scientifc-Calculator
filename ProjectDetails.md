## Summary
This is the second and updated version of my personal developer portfolio.\
I find that websites using complex designs can be interesting, however when well executed, a clean and minimal website often offers a more enjoyable experience for the user. This is the core philosophy I had when designing and creating this website. 

## Technical Details
For the initial idea mock-ups and design prototypes I used **Figma**.\
For development of the website I used the **React** JavaScript framework inside of Visual Studio Code IDE.\
For hosting the website, I used **GitHub Pages** with a custom domain name.
